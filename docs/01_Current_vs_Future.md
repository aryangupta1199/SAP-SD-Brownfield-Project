Current State (SAP ECC)
- Manual sales order entry and validations.
- Complex pricing, prone to manual errors.
- Traditional SAPGUI interface, minimal self-service for end users.
- Separate customer/vendor master data, occasional duplicates.
- Lag in real-time order tracking and analytics.

Future State (SAP S/4HANA)

- Optimized, simplified pricing configuration.
- Unified business partner master data (CVI complete).
- Real-time dashboards and order tracking for users.
- Reduced manual intervention, improved customer experience.

Goal:
Reduce the average order processing time from 25 minutes â†’ under 15 minutes per order, while improving data integrity and user satisfaction.
