Executive Summary
In this hands-on personal project, I led the end-to-end brownfield migration of a legacy SAP ECC system to SAP S/4HANA for a fictional manufacturing company. I focused on enhancing the Order-to-Cash (O2C) process to reduce order cycle time by 40% and improve business agility.

Key Objectives:
- Automate and streamline order processing using S/4HANA and Fiori apps.
- Migrate vital sales/master data with zero data loss.
- Simplify pricing and integrate real-time reporting.
- Practice all core SAP project roles: documentation, configuration, testing.
